          <br>
          During my time at Torque Digital, I had the pleasure of rebranding one of the defining buildings of the Chicago Skyline. We pitched several possible logos and the client ultimately chose my direction. I wanted to take the clean bold lines of the building and it's iconic crown and blend them into the number itself.

          Goose Island Brewpubs was looking to create a varient on their chicago flag logo to be used on their mugs for Oktoberfest. I chose to replicate this with a bold German style font and diamonds reminicent of Oktoberfest patterns.
