          <h4><b>SUMMARY</b></h4>
          <p>
          This was my first self driven bloc project, and I wanted to incorporate my love of all things craft beer. I wanted to create a place where people could learn about beer, find beer, and talk about beer with their friends.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4><b>PROBLEM</b></h4>
          <p>
          Craft beer is a seemingly daunting product to newer consumers. While it's just beer to some, the culture and the learning curve can be a real deterrent to new consumers. My goal was to find the largest issues users felt as a craft beer consumer and address them.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4><b>PROCESS</b></h4>
          <p>
          The first part of understanding this project was to gather some user research. To start, I created a survey. The main things I was looking for were the type of beer consumer the users were and how they used similar applications.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          <p>
          I gathered over 800 responses from the survey and from that data I was able to generate some user personas to categorize common users. From those personas, I generated user stories and user flows to determine all the features the app needed to include.
          <br>
          From this, I determined that a generalized app with more of a focus on education, community, and suggestion would be more effective than a beer finding app.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4><b>WIREFRAMING</b><h4>
          <p>
          From my user flows, I determined all the features necessary for the app, and from that created low fidelity wireframes. While primitive, these were incredibly influential on every following step of the design process.
          </p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          From these early wireframes, I translated them into higher fidelity wireframes.
          </p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <h4><b>BRAND IDENTITY</b><h4>
          <p>
          At this time I wanted to establish the branding for the app. This included determining the name, color pallete, typeface, and logo.
          After choosing my typeface I created a type specimen, which in turn helped inform my color pallete.
          </p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          The naming process didn't take me much time as I wanted an approachable and fun name that also referenced the product of beer. From the name I quickly came to a logo through some sketching pen, paper, as well as illustrator.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4><b>MOCKUPS</b><h4>
          <p>
          Upon establishing the brand identity, I began to apply the brand styling to the wireframes.
          </p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          From these fleshed out wireframes, I was able to develop a working prototype on invision. To determine the usablility of this prototype, I sent it out to several users to determine how effective the app was. The main thing I was looking for was an intuitive nature to the design and ease of navigation.

          <h4><b>CONCLUSION</b><h4>
          <p>
          From this project I was able to learn a great deal about designing at mobile constraints, as well as the amount of user research necessary to create a quality end product.
